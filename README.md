## Focus of this lesson

We'll look at the infrastructure of deploying an app to production and not the app itself.

## What you need

* Git must be installed and available on command line
  * `git --version` in a terminal should not produce an error. 
  * [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it.
* Node.js with npm must be installed and available on command line
  * `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal should not produce an error.
  * You should have a Node.js version 10 or later and npm version 6 or later.
  * [Install Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org) if you don't have it.
* A good text editor of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/). If you don't have a favorite already, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/).
* If you are completely new to JavaScript, it is recommended to explore and test the language beforehand.

## How to get started
