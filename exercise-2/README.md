# Exercise 2 - Running and building our application locally

To see what our application looks like and to get a development feedback loop, we are going to build and run it locally on your machine. 

### 2.1 - Running the app

:pencil2: Go into the `code` folder and write `npm install`. This will install all the neccecary dependencies to run the app locally. 

:pencil2: Type `npm start` to start the application. You should see something like this on your screen. 

:book: Short about tests

:pencil2: Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in your terminal in order to stop the application. Type `npm test` in order to run the application tests. 

:book: Short about linting

:pencil2: Type `npm run lint` in order to run the linter to check the quality of our code. 

If you were able to successfully perform all the operations above, you are officially in the "it works on my machine" phase of the development lifecycle. The real challenge is to get it to work on someone elses computer, aka "The Cloud" :tm:
