# Exercise 4 - Deploying the app to Azure Static Websites

We are going to use Azure Static Web Sites to deploy our application and make it available on the internet. 

To avoid having to register an account, we have predefined a set of application environments in Azure where you can deploy your application. You have been provided with an API-key and a URL of the web application. In order to deploy your application, you will need to make use of the API-key in order to gain deploy access to the Azure environment.
